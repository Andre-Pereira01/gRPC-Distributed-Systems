# gRPC-Distributed-Systems
We have created a client/server system that allows external operators to simulate accessing the system created to proceed with the Reservation, Activation, Deactivation and Termination of a fiber line associated with a home, according to a defined modality. The reservation process is considered to be synchronous and, at the request of the customer, the server returns information on whether or not it was possible to reserve the resource at the address sent for the modality in question, indicating the associated reservation number. The remaining processes (Activation, Deactivation and Termination) are asynchronous. Thus, when an external operator wants to activate, deactivate or terminate a fiber line, it will send a request to the server that will be executed a priori and the customer will receive a notification in a message subscription system to which he must subscribe beforehand. We then create the User, Coverage and operations models. Then we create the database with the corresponding tables and relations. We also created the provisioning protocol and its services, we also created the services to connect to RabbitMQ (queue management service for receiving and delivering messages between applications. We also use Docker, which is necessary to run RabbitMQ in a container).
